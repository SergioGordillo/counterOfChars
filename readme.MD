I have written this algorithm in JS. In terms of time complexity, we are talking about a O(n) complexity, a linear one, because the longer the input, the more time it will consume to execute the algorithm. 

Regarding space complexity, in the worst of the cases, if all the characters of the input are unique, we would need to store n keys in the object, being n the length of the input.
The object where we store the chars has also n elements, therefore the space complexity is O(n).

The overall complexity of this algorithm is O(n), one of the most efficients complexities an algorithm can have.
